# From Bacteria to Beef
As an alternative to real beef, Rosa is interested in synthesizing bacterial proteins that taste like beef.  Improbable Beef (a food startup) is teaming up with Rosa's lab to determine potential bacterial candidate species that can be harvested within the human navel.
To test the hypothesis, Rosa has sampled several navels throughout the country to colonize the bacterial species that live within the belly button.  The participants are anonymous, given ID numbers through the website Rosa is using to display information for participants to lookup their bacterial results.

## Gitpage

The above gitpage is a website that is used to sort the partisans by number and shows the first recipient is ID 940.  Using the Test Subject ID No, each participants bacterial data cultures that are found within the navel are described and plotted using the bar chart.  There is a gauge that shows how often the participant washes their navel, and a bubble chart describing the Bacteria Cultures per Sample. It also, gives a summary of the participants demographic information (e.g Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Location, BBtype, WFREQ)
